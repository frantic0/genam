! BOUNDARY CONDITIONS
! 
! the usual BC for the Helmholtz PDE is to give the flux on the boundary
! also define the Dirichlet boundary conditions for all the primary field variables -- in our case the real component of pressure, Pressure 1
! can also define the Sommerfeldt or far field BC
! Elmer mesh files (mesh.*) contain information on how the boundaries of the bodies are divided into parts distinguished by their own boundary numbers
! Target Boundaries is used to list the boundary numbers that form the domain for imposing the boundary condition
